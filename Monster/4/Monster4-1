(2:19)
Yks, i konw you are able to speak. You've been identified at the scene of crimes of 4 murders, involing in mid-age couple in the past 2 year.

there is no point to deny it. what do you say? we speak, Mr Yks?

en. All right, ok. I can [sw----] better tell you that we have already konwn you're a just "lock picker". your job is [strim---] undoing locks

you could never possiblly slit the throats in one single slash with such cold-boold greeds, Yks. No, that's not your work.
now, that means you'd to be other [com---]involved. and I'm thinking there would have to be at least 3 of you in order to do both, 
open a strong lock, and muder a mid-age couple without resistents , that sounded about right?
we 're almost through comparing a list of suspects who we've already known for skills of knives. it is only a matter of time before we are able to [narrow] it down to one name.  
Whether you decide to coroperate us or not.

However, i must confess that is not really what i want to ask you about.
what i'm really like to know, Mr Yks, is why 4 couples from accross Germany, and everyone of couple's mid-aged without children.
Money and items were stolen, but we know the amount is too small to justify the murdering for the minor of third of it.

all right, so tell me, Are you up for some negotiation? if you confess now, we'll dimiss  all charges against you.
so, tell me who is the person who hired you to do this.

a...a...a...a....

Mr Yks, it all right.it all right. that's it, the interigation is over right now.

i don't think so, we almost there.

Get out of here, as a doctor, i'm ordering you.

very well, but i'll be coming back at later time, and just make sure he isn't poisoned or doesn't disappeared i want to send a guarder to watch him closely.

that shouldn't strike him on, there always seems to be so much trouble happening all around you,doctor, Tenma.  

what exactly are you trying to say?

oh,nothing, really. Well then, we will keep in touch.

hold on ,where are you goning?
