i knew a man who loved this song
he isn't a good dancer either.

so, he did know dance like this

that's right.

how fun
how about another drink, just one more

thanks, but i'm good.

oh, night [---]

time for bed

sounds good to me, babe.

there is one more thing i want to ask you.

what's that?

the pictures, where are they?

what pictures?

don't play dumb

those photograhs you took out of the album.
where did you hide them?
tell me

you see [---] a little secret.
you're looking for Tenma, aren't you?
i know you get those photos from Berlin.
and i'm sure you have them with you somewhere

what are you saying?
you know where Tenma is?

yeah

hahha....

photograhs you're talking about, there was one with father and that boy, am i right?

Youhan, wasn't itï¼Ÿ
hahha...
i've seen him, you know.
bright charming, handsome, he is ground well
i saw him, a year ago, in Dorsodfor

Kanzu, let's start over, you, you need me.
Kanzu, you belong to me. i will get you back, because you are mine.

so, what are you up to these days?
i've heared all sorts of rumors.

the rumors are probably ture.
i've been married and divoced 3 times now.
between my father and inheritence [---], i'm living pretty comfortably.
but enough about me.
how was life be treating you, Doctor Beck?

a? i don't know, nothing changes with me.
i still have no chances of moving up to the world.
speaking a witch, Tenma is now a chief of surgery.
well, he is on his way to become the hospital director
loving to be his shoes, let me tell you
oh, please who am i kidding.
i didn't so bad
i'm still managing to have good time 
there is more too lifes than promotions
i'd never want to be like Tenma, have no time for women and fun
what's the point?

it's Kanzu
do you know by any chances of doctor Tenma ever did settle down?

no, not yet.
and big honestly, i introduce him to a quiet few very nice women.
but you know him, no interest at all
