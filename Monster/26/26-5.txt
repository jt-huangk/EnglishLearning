i'm sorry

just let me out of the car.

can you see the lake from here?

a

who lives here always gets so beautiful in the fall.

yeah, very much so.

wait, something is missing.

what happened to the wrens, why don't i hear the chirping of the wrens?

yeah, i know, i'm so sorry
this place is changed, they've turned it into a construction

hey, you can hear them, Carl?
if you listen very carefully, you can make them out.
little birds delightly chirp in the trees
many apples have ripened, falling to the ground
here

and when you turn at this direction, he will see a spectacular site.
autumn leaves and a blazing color in the afternoon sun
reflected on the calm surface of the water, like a huge mirror.
he must see it.
don't you sir?
it's hard to believe such wonder exists?

i see it, i can see it.

back up a second, i just remember something.

en..

you told me that you had 2 pairs of visitors
and you mentioned that the black hair boy brought a girl with him.
so then, that means the brown brought someone.

oh, yeah, that's right.
he did bring somebody with him

that kid kept mumbling his world, i could barely understand what he was talking about.
the gorgeous boy who came along with him ended up doing the talking, 
he was the one gave him a lowdown, and a truth be told

hhaha, if it is good looking pal, would it turned around and claimed he was Shuval's son
i would not have any trouble to believe in him 

who's the other guy? tell me.
