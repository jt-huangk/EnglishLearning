we spent countless hours hunting down that serial killer and had him in our sights
but you were drunk as hell and kill him.

i'm very busy in investigating with important criminal cases.

a, i want to check out the crime scene
i persume everything has been preserved, right?

i've already given it go and had it cleaned out since it has been determined that there is no crime.
they will be removing all of the deceased affects sometime today

dammit

it appears that he wrote this suicide note from this desk
here is the paper he was in the middle of writing
the birth of tragedy, process of reality, world views on psychology
proffer the course for a philosophy student
these must be the materials he was using for his paper
Caesar's Gallic wars?
