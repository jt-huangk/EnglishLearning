i would encourage you to keep looking at your old police notebook

but why?
i will just get angry again.

stop thinking that way.
you have to analyze what you did in the past in the new night.
your mind is clear now, that should help.
let's be frank with each other.
we both know that you've shot a young serial killer when you were drunk.
and i must say you are facing the reality of what happened in that night pobably
but now ,Ricahrd.
you face a far great challenge
facing your thoughts when you pull that trigger.
you are still haunted by that boy, you see him in your mind everyday, don't you?

yeah

when you brought everything to light, all those things festering under the surface.
that boy's ghost will finally move on.

i see, when i brought everything to light.
the [---] murder cases is a good place to start,
the victim, Vick Homen, had a long and steady career as an accounter
he was never involoved in anything [shding---], and had no enemies
and when he was murdered, there were no signs of robbery
then there were those 2 [--] god cases, the victims were former house keeper and [---]
what connected to those 2 killers, was that the words i've heared the voice of god were left?
[--] on the walls at both crime scenes.  
the [---] [---] company president case, [---] was one of the wealth business man in Babavia
and his body was discoveried in the [---] forest
en, and then there is a spirit couple case. both were forcable drown and their bodys were washed along on the [---] river later on
this one is still being inverstigated as one of string murders involoved in middle aged couples
the material witness of that case disappeared, japanese doctor is still on the run.
oh, man

the more unsolved cases i have, the more [---] i drink.
then it felt good.
but it is different now
this is tough, it feels just like the doctor's said.
Sanmen Solmen, my mind is clear and i'm feeling calm.

hold on a second, come on, think
be [---], Ricahrd

so you try to do it again, so what was the result?

i did, i looked all my notes, and i thought something new, but then i ...

you saw that boy's ghost again, and once that happened ,you lost your train of thought, right?

hah

there is no need to worry.
when you have an improtant thought like that, sooner or later, it will come back to you

what was that i realized?
the idea flashed through my mind, it felt like it was the key to solve one of those cases.

a? just my imagination

who's there?
show yourself!
whoever you are, i will catch you

this is like that time, where you back
i was running after that [---], just like this, i chased hime down in the alley

a

sorry for coming here so later night, doctor

none of sense, if you're thinking you figure things out, you are ready to share them, go ahead
tell me everything

back then, i feel myself looking deep with that killer.
that's when i knew it exists in this world
what was true evil, and once i saw it ,standing right there, in front of me
i shot him and killed him

that's good ,thanks for sharing, Ricahrd
by telling me this, you will be on the road to recovery.

there is still more, doctor.
it just came to me.

en?

that idea that flashed through my mind before.
all of those unsolved cases i have been working to solve separately
i realized that they are actually one single case.

a?
