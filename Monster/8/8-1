I don't blame you for saving my brother life anymore.
you did what you have to do as a doctor, it wasn;t your fault.
please eat these sanwiches and get some rest too.
please live on, and continue to save as many people as you are able to.

Lina Fortel.

what are you planning to do? are you going to kill your brother a second time?
i did it, i brought him back to life, that monster.
it was me, i brought him back to life.

there are a lot of blood vessels in this arterial venous malforamtion 
cut all arterias, now the venous, extraction of the 9 [---] complete

wow, that went very well.

yes, as usual.

his remarkable quick with clipping.

and an amazing operation.

doctor Tenma, how was it possible, even after a long break, the work of geninus like you only gets better and better. 

it is over.
never mind, it is not important.

isn't that wonderful, Kanzu?

it wasn't even about me, it was all about your father.

well, that may be true, but it only because you did such a wonderful job last night working as a father's team.
i'm sure he appericates all your hard work, since you are the one responsible for raising the hospital's reputation.

no, i'm the one should be gradeful.
i mean, after all, it is thanks to your father, that actually i'm able to work here, in Germany.

hang on in there, if you stick with the father, your future will be granted.
it won't be long father becomes the chairmain of the board, soon after that, you will be the chief of surgery, and then chief director.
en, it means i will be the director's wife, you'd better make me happy,Kanzu. Because hardship doesn't suit me.
still want to go out that date, or say we just....

oh, please, sir. but Madam is resting at the moment.

i won't need much of time, this shouldn't take very long.

but, sir, you really need to make an appointment with the madam

where is other [---]?

i'm terrible sorry to bother you, madam.
but there is a police officer here.

the police?

Mrs Ave,Himman, it's been a while, hasn't it?

and who are you supposed to be?
i work on your father's case, exactly 9 years ago. i'm spector LongGai, of the BKA

LongGai, i see, you may leave this house.

i remember you ,all too well.

you're that good for nothing enough detective who cloudn't even close my father's case.
so .tell me what on earth do you want from me now?

i'm qiute impressed, you're able to matain this residence exactly the same, even after your father's death.
actually, it appears that the [collons] might get even more [strc----ment]  than before.

so, then, you've came to see how much money i've made from inherts my father left me and my divoice settlements.

as you can see, detective, i live absolutely comfort.
if you see anything you like, please feel free to take with you.
as long as i have my liquid by my side, i'm fine.

i come today, because i have something to show you.
here, take a look at this neck tie.
 
a neck tie?

doesn't it look familar?
perhaps you don't remember, it's designed from 9 years ago,it has very simple print, but if you look at it carefully, it is a wonderful piece with a extremely [a---] wave

so, what? what about it?

tracing it back is quite a task, after all, it was purchased 9 years ago, but luckly, this was a limited diction offering, especially made from particully stores high and clients.
and your name is on that list, mrs Ave.

so ,what it exactly is your point?

you see, i was wondering if you might purchase this and give it to someone as a gift.
this neck-tie is a key piece of evidence to another murder case

a murder?
who knows. i gave gifts to so many men, i couldn't possible keep track them, could i?
i'm not intresting in it anyway, the only thing there i after is my money

please try to remember.

i told you i don't remember, there man are after my money.
there is a single person who truly loves me for who i'm.
that's why i always stick to them when there is time for the divoce selttlement.
i did tell 3 of them.
oh ,damn bastard.
do you want something too, do you want something, just tell me.
but you pay a high price for it.

i'll be back, if you remember anything,please give me a call

next time, you step by, detective. be sure to bring me something to drink.

execute me?

Eva? Eve, please, you have to talk to your father for me, make him see i have not done anything wrong,
