i'm looking for a dinner with a view of beautiful crime of sky. 
we sure everything stays on schedule, otherwise, my perfect dinner will be ruined
until then, if anything goes wrong, forgiveness, we come to very high price.

yes, sir

he won't do it, Youhan isn't going to lead you .
you will never be able to convince Youhan to lead your organization, are you out of your mind?
Youhan doesn't share your simple minded views on racial purity.
he isn't just an ignorant bigot like all of you 
he is different, don't you see?
he looks down on all humanity.

Silence...

well, well. what do we have here.

hey, give this gentleman a drink on me, i'm thinking the usual.
