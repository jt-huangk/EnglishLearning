Good morning, Lina

Good morning.

You are looking much better, i'm so glad.

I was really scared when you faint by that, you know.

I guess you really didn't like the boy we hooded you up with.

no, that's not at all.

i just feel sick all of a sudden. I need to apologize to him.

oh, Never mind, you don't have to worry about him. Trust me.

well, it turns out when I talk [about the articles], i found out he was not your Prince Charming on the white horse after all.
yeah, we asked, he said he didn't know anything at all about these email messages.

oh, really?

so ,you're saying that you fainted right after you saw this particluar boy at your campus.

Yes.

well  what did this fellow look like?

I only saw him for a second, i'm  not  really sure.

And do you remember exactly what you feel at your monment when you saw him? 

i remember i felt lethargic

en...

but, maybe not. i don't know how to explain it.

go on.

just take it easy, don't force yourself.

absolute evil.

en???

i don't know how to put it, but, yes, it felt just like when i used to have that nightmare.

en, absolute evil, it sounds more like it has to do with you religious believes.

i don't think so, i'm not really want to go to church regularly.
but i think if i see this young man again, it may help to clarify things for me

you're thinking this may help you to recover your memories, is that it?

yes.

I suppose that is one way to go about it, but i don't think you should allow this 
to disturb the peace you have.
it is important you continue to focus on your future, and road ahead.

can i?

don't wrorry, just work up a sweat doing your aikido  and your anxiety should disappear.

hi,[---], so did you pull another all nighter?

yeah.

BTW, i'm just wondering will you the one who told that person he can use the file room?

the weird guy.

i ask him what he was doing there, he said you've gave him permission to look through archives

you mean he is still in there?

Hey, you. time to hit the road.

hey, are you all right?
Hey...

come on, eat up. 

thank you

Good, isn't it?

i always come to here for breakfast.

so, don't you ever eat at home then, what about your family?

I have got one, my wife walked out on me a while ago.

a...

i was always too busy with the work, before i knew it, my wife left with our daughter and moved back with her parents 

do you ever think about trying to patch something up with her?

why would i do that? she's the one who walked out on me, why should i have to be the one to go after her?

oh, it just seems like you regret spending so much time on work.

it's completely nonsense.

Work is priority number 1, you hear.
Any woman can understand such a simple fact, welcome her to leave whenever she wants.

sorry about that, i didn't mean to pry.

this's right, this is none of your business.

oh, another thing, please do forgive me, 
but you smoke too much, as a doctor, i recommend you cut back.

i told you aleady, this is none of your business.
you're beginning to sound just like the wife of mine.

well, what's so bad about that? it means she cares about your health.

just mind your own damn business.

is that means a birthday present?

Yes, i was finally able to finish it.

Godnees, i remember when her sweaters used to be this tiny.

Honey, do we really have to tell her? does she have to know that she is not our real daughter.

why not just leave it alone?

you're right, there is no point to tell her that, now.
Lina is our daughter, that's all there is to it

i'm home.

welcome back.

i'm so hungry, all i have to do is focus on  my future,
yes, maybe doctor [Geidel] is right after all.

see you tomorrow at 7pm at Heidelberg castle for your birthday.
tomorrow, at Heidelberg castle.

I'm a very busy man, i have been staring at newspaper clippings with you for days.
i admire your gumption, but, don't you think it's about time to give up?

en...

hey, doctor, if, i say if i want to ask my wife to come home again,
do you really think she will give it another go?

yeah, if you kick that happen one day.

what is it?

found it.

11 year old boy goes missing, there is a prossibility that the child has been abducted
but there have been no ransom demands made as of yet.
