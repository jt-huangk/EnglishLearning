formali sir in the french [---] region, then free lands in [---] in 1979
from 1981 to 1984, they assisted the [grand---] rebels in [Afuge].
then in 1987, you palyed a key role in assilating [---] leaders, in the top of [---] secrect [---] operation.
it's a quiet an impressed resume, i must admit, isn't it, Mr.[---]?

i have no doubt that [mercy--nery] must be quiet a teacher,
and i'm sure a number of distinguish men must have been under your instruction

it might be a good idea to send some of our old office to attend your [---] to wit them to shap.

yeah, that would be great.

incidently, was this man here a good student by any chance?

i believe he showed in your training program about 5 months ago.
we know that he is a genius with this [sgaball]
what i'm wondering about is whether he has a talent with gun  

i don't devote informations about my people to anyone, period.

of course, you don't.

so, have you ever tried with a gun before?

no

i guess you  self taughtthen.

actually, i have never shot a gun before.

en, what? you mean not even once?

right. i know i'm asking for an improssible.
they said, you're the only hope, right now.

it makes no difference, i make all my students forget everything they learned before they get here.
but this, this's the first time i'll be teaching someone who never shot a gun before.

jump [----], reguard your experience and [---] up, this is everyone's starts. jump up like the child over there.

i said "fast"

balance, this is all about banlance.

come on, fast

i said "fastâ€œ

obviously, i can't jump openly as well as you do

tell me something, is this what you do? you know, always superise student training like this.

all right, i understand.
you don't have to keep on staring me like that, i will do it
i know i have to do.

hey, it's a birdling, i wonder if he is looking for food for his [chicks].

what's wrong, you're too tired to eat?

yes,

you can't train if you pass out.

yes, sir.

she is your daughter or grand-daughter

neither

the little girl was the daughter of woman i killed,
shot it down right before her very eyes, back in [---]
a mission in a jungle [---] for a shelter
and there she was, with her mother.

her mother was holding a gun, if i had been [f] for a second, i would be me died that day.
