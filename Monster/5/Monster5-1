Now ,class, i want you to tell me what was the basis for the ruling the judge made in regards to the 1968 [-----] case.

oh, boy. what is this silence! where are we? some kind of a monastery?
Mr [---], i would like to hear your answer if you have one.

well, sir. that is to say, en....

anyone, is there anyone in this room can break this silence?

so the chronic late-comer is here at last, 
you're 30m tardy, seems your part time pizza delivery job keep you only busy today.

i'm sorry, professor [---]  
well, let me ask you a question before you sit down.
do you have enough strength left to tell me the basis for the ruling in the 1968 [----] case.

oh, yes. well, the defense claim that the kidnapping was a sham, and the victim's death had been due to the poisoning,
after the investigation into the crime scene, it was found the victim's death have been accidental, and there was no motive.
so since the crime couldn't be proven to be the intentional murder, i believe a sentence of 15 years was handed down. 

en, very good, you can take your sit, Lina [---].

Yes, professor.

(3:20)
well, good job, Lina. if no one had been able to give the answer, i have no doubt that [---] would probaly demand we write a 50 pages report

50 pages, if we are not

i have to treat our savor Lina this something to eat. what do you say, Lina. nice meal ,just 2 of us?
I'm sorry, Peter. but I have a club meeting today.

people end up confuse, losing side of who they are.
but who you are is something you can spend your whole life trying to [grace], but never figure it out compeletely.

we are always projecting and trying to look into the future. we spend our whole life looking for the answers and do the best that we can

that's very good. 
All right, i think the pricess is to the end of our [---tion].

bye, thank you doctor.
