it's not about the money
i couldn't care unless if i said any part of his fortune

but Carl

no, if they want rob Shuval blind, they can go right ahead
who cares

but why?

because, because i can't stand the thought of this bastard far pretending to be my mother's son.
there is no forgive something like that.

with the [---] of your [---] flowers way in the brezze.
the crying of the [---] birds run through into my heart.

you have not told me to stop reading yet.
why is that, sir?

en?
i [---] you all the time, why do you insist on coming back?
is the money that good?

that is not the why?

with all do respect, sir. it is nothing like that
is money the only incentive to do something in your world?

in my world, or any other.
what are they alike? your parents?

actually, i was raised by a serials of foster families

i see, forgive me for pry.
would you meet your real parents if you could.

well, sir, i actually..

yes, this young man who reads to me just maybe the one i was waiting for 
it doesn't seem to be after my money.

who is he?

never mind, i'm talking to myself.
it's time we call it a day, Linmen
oh, one more thing, regarding your Latin, boy, it is much improved.

well, thank you very much, sir.

looks like Amen [hook---] today too.
bet it is late for the bad call something like that

tomorrow is thursday, he will be there.
he will be in the mansion and so would i

oh, i get it.
you are gonna to [--] in the [---] right in the front of Shuval, right?
that's awesome
let's go and get him already.

still there is no sign of him, he should be there a hour ago.

if he [--] sick into bed, at least where we could find him.

hey, we bargin into his room, we can find him there.

hold on, don't tell me you look up Forten's address

en, hey

202 and 204, jackpot

here we go.
knock...

a?

it's so [---] around here, the whole school's talking about what happen to Amen Forten
who could thought he would kill himself.
the school paper actually printed the suicide, didn't they?
i can no long continue to deceive
so that's what is all about

i guess so
spending all the time with Shuval, acting like his son
maybe the guilty just blind inside him

if he knew he would grow conscience he'd better off not try in the first place.

Lorta, yesterday must be in tough.

yeah, don't you know it
since we are the ones who discover the body, the police hold us for questioning all day.

i didn't end up reading today after all.
