i never have feelings about it. it's just my job.
it's one day, i was doing what i always did, waiting to kill some faceless guy
it was sunny, and he was alone.
i have been doing it so long, and i was lone.
i didn't know how many i killed, or who was next.
i have them as good as dead, he ordered a coffee.
and i watched, he started to put sugar in it.
one spoon fill, 2 spoon fill, three, and four, after the fifth spoon fill
he stopped
where the moment, started me finally tasting the coffee i drank
when i saw him how enjoy that coffee, i couldn't do it.
that was the day i put my gun down for good
that part of my life is down, i know i can kill people and steal the simple pleasure.
after all the time we spend together, i don't get it, you never ask me to teach you how to kill someone.

i decided, i decided that getting you invloved was not good in right 

you really have to go, Lina?

en,en..., goodbye.
thank you for everything, Mr Winson

you should know, killing is easier than you think.
you just have to forget how sweet the sugar is
