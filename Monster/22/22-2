why wait?

i've never seen him.
do you suspect he is the one who broken in and murdered my neighbors?

for the moment, i can only say it is the personal interest 
but i will ask everybody in the neighborhood for their cooperation in this matter.
if you see this man, just act normal, i don't want him to become suspecious
then get touch with me as soon as you possibly can 
that will be all that i need you do
i personally assure you he won't be in any danger.

hard to image such a tragedy like this happened in here, it is such a pleasant. quiet neighborhood.

it really is, and Youpens were such nice people, just the best
when i call out her for my doorsteps, Mrs Youpen would always greet me cheerfully

that's very interesting
i've been told Mrs Youpen've lost her hearing about a year ago, and refuse to hearing aid

a? are you sure?

it was in the medical record.
if i had to guess, she really couldn't hear any of your greetings.

oh, well, annoy type of person she was
she probably sends my present to make me feel good.

so then. in your opinion, nobody in the neighborhood know about her lost hearing either.

en, no. i wouldn't think so

it certain appears that your business is blooming.
