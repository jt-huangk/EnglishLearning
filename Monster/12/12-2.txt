the place was thrown into [unlike] king was [-----] chaos, they couldn't even control the children.
it was everyman for himself.
it's a miricial John made it out alive

then what, what exactly happened to 511 Kinderheim?

everybody there died.

what?

all of the instructors and every last orphan except Jhon, those people mass kill each other.

the world is not dark place, it's a lie, tomorrow will be a good day, i promise.

Diter, time to get up your things, honey.

Excuse me, Mr Hartman, but where are we going, go home now?

no, we take a little ditour,

but i don't want to go back there.

no, no,  i don't want to go

Diter, Diter, come on now , be a good boy

what do you mean?
i told you not to let Diter leave with anyone until i came back , didn't i?

but all i did was....

the person was the child's froster father.
and let me tell you, he is a very much gentelman, unlike you, obviously

look, i'm sorry, but that man...

i wouldn't worry, that boy seemed very happy to be going with him.

Diter

Diter, i'm here.

Diter?

they are not back yet.

Hartman's library

this photos were taken at different times, but they were all shot in the same location
so what am i looking at?

Jhon? who is the man in the photo next to him?

yes, that's it.
every single one of these photographes was taken in the 511 Kinderheim
it likes they were taken over 10 years ago.

all of the instructors and every last orphan except John
those people masskill each other

Diter, could he be the other?

Diter
just hold on ,i'm coing

this child is blind at what i'm showing him

Hartman

he can't see it, he can't even [compare---] what John saw.
he is not like him
it's no good, it fails again
this boy is no Jhon
every single one of them died here, did you know?

10 years ago, the instructors and the orphans, all 50 people died
Jhon stand here, just watch it all happen.
he just stands here, and watch everything
he didn't [---] finger, he just watched
i had to know his secrect, so i asked Jhon what he've done?
and this was what he answered, 
he dropped a piece of oil [---] into the fire, like this.
do you get it?
do you know what he meant by that?
"i simply added a bit of fuel to the hatred bowl when people come together. it was easy"

that was he told me, only 10 years old, and he said that.
and he did it at no affects at all.
he was able to make 50 people to kill each other without even moving a finger.

it's you, it was you and your damn experiment that twisted Jhon into what he is.

so you think it was us?
and sorry, it wasn't us at all.
we didn't make it that way, it was true that 511 Kinderheim was a experimental project,
specifically, to transform orphans into perfect soliders. 
thinking back it now, it was only a little experiment
as for Jhon, he is no solider, not at all.
he is better, he was a natural born leader of man.
someone who was meant to stand at the very top of the world
there is no way we could have ever created such a work of heart
