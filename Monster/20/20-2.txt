i never truly believe that we would be able to take a big trip together
but here, we plan for.

sir, i'm sorry

not to mention the trouble we have ever order food
you may help us [---] to have someone like you to travel with us
[----] doing so bad with this bloody language

there's nothing we can do, i'm afraid.
except we find a gas station and bring some back.

look, there comes a trunk.
hey, stop.
hey, over here.

what's wrong, we run out of gas

that's kind of problem out of here.
there is no man's land

en, well i have got 2 rooms for 2 of you in my cab

is that ok?

somebody should take the [---] on his offer. 

don't worry about us, we will be all right.
we work something out.

with galon of gas for you.

my eyes may be deceiving me.
