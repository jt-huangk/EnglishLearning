give me a gun

a?

look, there are something i get to do.

remember, that model is tended for close range work
you only get 4 shots , so make them count.

don't worry about me, i was an officer once upon the time.

just be careful

can't have me die before you take me to the police and have me confessed to kill your parent, is that it?

that's right.
so don't even think of die on me
i cover you from the empty house next door, good luck.

hi, dady

hi, Fres

dady, look, it's the fishing [--]

Fres just kept on insisting, he had to go fishing with his dady.

Babala, thank god

where is Rebetal?

oh, that reminds me

the gentelmen from his security team are here, he said something happened when we were out.

his team?

there is no need to worry.

he said everything is fine, no one was hurt.

oh, Rebetal, look, Mike's come home

everything is all right, it was nothing important, just broken window 
probably just the kids from the neighborhood.
nothing to worry about, nothing at all

where is the body?
what have you done with him, damnit?

a body? what are you talking about?

what's going on? Rebetal?
who the hell are you?

Fres and little wife here had insight
don't be stupid.

all right, gentleman, nothing ever happened here, understood?
just another boring day in paradise, right?
like yesterday, and tomorrow.
