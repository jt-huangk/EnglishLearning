yes, he did, for a year infact.

he said they took care good of him, he was like a son to them.

wait a minute, i had my eye on that house for month, never saw anyone who look like that.

they were a wonderful family. i have a picture, the councilman, wife and me. 

however, there was something i couldn't forgive them for.
there was a beautiful area under their property, a better sunflowers in the yard,
but oneday, the councilman cleared it up in order to build a big trailway.
so i mentioned it to my young friend, and i thought it was aweful, i was delight to
discover he agreed.

wait, are you going to say you're kill them because of some flowers?

hardly, there was more to it.
he also told me, councilman Springer had a mistress.
that's when my friend looked into me and said, 
"i have decided i no longer wish to live with thought to be a member of Springer household"
"From now on, i'm not a part of that family any more"
then he proceed to request me that i erase the family.

having a mistress is so excusable, my mother was someone's mistress too, she was a capital woman, you know.

listen,listen, don't think about all that stuff.
btw,did all the safer in this house?

i believe on the second floor in the library.

right then.

doctor, you  probably should stay around here.

you can erase your past, don't you know that?
if you don't like it, you can erase everything. you can erase all of it.
you can erase such a tired life if you like

sorry, i don't agree that at all, you may try to foget, but no one can simply erase their past like that.

yeah, i guess you're right.

i wonder why i thought that, doesn't make any sense to me right now.

why did i think i can erase the past by pulling the trigger.
looking back, i wonder why i listened to him, did what he asked me.

i think you should go now, out talk is over, i have nothing more to say.

oh, that's right, your name is doctor Tenma, isn't it? he left a message behind for you.
do make sure you take a good look at it. you find it in the councilman's library.

he predicted that you would come here, and he was correct about that. 

here we go, he mentioned to me, your fate has already been decided for you, so as mine.

doctor, i told you, did i? 
did you actually shot tbis guy?
oh, suicide, i get you.
what the hell...

what's the use in dying? everything is over when you're dead.
it makes no sense.
doctor, it's nothing like to living, am i right?

you know, i think i'm actually agree with you for a change.

hey, what exactly do you mean for "for a change"?
anyway,so you're after the killer, name [Youhan] whatever.
i don't get it, i really don't know why you do that.

hey, why don't you forget about this nosense, in team up with me.

oh, btw, i don't know why,  when i try to open the door of this room before, kind give me some creepies.

en?
