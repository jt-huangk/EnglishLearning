one Manhattan, have a bottle  

wait a second, where is the cherry?

it's not Manhattan without the cherry.

yeah, my mistake

i'll let it slide this time

business always goes well when i'm sucking on one of these.

a lucky charm is a lucky charm

come to pap,i just hope there is still something valuable of taking

well, well, well, look what we get here.
it's a five finger free for all.
wonder if there is anything valuable enough for a connoisseur like [------].
you never know what is going to happen.
for as you shoe in Canada for governor, next thing you and your wife get shot.
now, well, down to business.

i'm guessing this is where to keep the safe.

i'm getting a chill, this is creepy as hell.
i have never feel anything like this.
could, could somebody be in there?

as if, what am i so scared about this, they like me to be a chicken 

don't move, put your hands behind your head.

oh, men, i can't believe this.

Damn bar attender, his fault to forget the cherry.

i said put your hands up.

all right, all right, give me a breaking on this one.
officer, i haven't take anything yet. i promise 

i'm not cop

no, so you're robbing this place too.

well,in that case, why don't you put that thing away. 
we have ourselves ...

please put your hands up, now.

Juese, what's with this guy? it's a big boy that gets afraid of cops 
you get be kidding me. this is for nothing, buddy.

come on, here.
don't follow me. someone like you just get in the way
you slow me down

i told you to stop following me.
how Damn it is today, it's just my day.

that's right, i though i recognized you,
you're all over the papers.

you're the doctor wanted for questioning in connection with councilman [springer's] murder 

and you? are you a thief?

that i'm, but i get something called morals, i don't go around killing people

you wouldn't know anything about the murder that happened in that house, would you?

no,i did. so get out of my face, would you?

hey, doctor, you're some sort of topnotch surgeon, aren't you?
my brilliant brain just come up with a fantastic idea.
do you think that people meet by chance that,dude.
they don't, believe me, i know.
i believe in fate, i think people meet for a reason.
and my gut tells you and I were destined to become partners.

call me crazy, but i think lot of folkers underground community need someone like you 
you know, guys who need highout, so they can go to regular doctor for help.

listen, you lead management all the [---] here, i'll make you world's the best underground doctor in no time 
i'm telling you, doc, you're gonna make a lot of money, you will be a millioner before you know it.

hey,hey,hey, doctor, where are you thinking of going?

there is something i have to do, i can't wait.

well ,i'd hold my horses if i were you.
you want to know about the murders in that house, don't you?

heiheihei,
more i guess you would like to hear that i saw the killer, am i right?

what do you say?
are you telling me the truth?

you want to know?

what did he look like? i need to know, was the killer blonde in about 20 years of age?

what a blonde about?

never mind, you just tell me about who you saw there?

team up with me, and i'd be happy to, doctor

he's on the third floor.

so how did you come to know all of this anyway?

i spent months checking out the councilman's house, 
case enjoyed, i do my homework.
just when i'm ready to make a move, the killer beats me to it.
15 minutes later, i look in the window, and they were dead.

i'm fooled, in well, i figured out i might be able to blackmail the murder, so i followed him here.

this is all you need to prove your innocence, doctor, you know what i'm saying.
all you have to do is call the police, and tell them
after that, we should go somewhere.
sit down, releax, talk over a drink about our future together as partners

hey, stop, what are you doing? 
what do you want to talk him in for?
what did you miss the part of he murders people?

man, what's he thinking?
looking for trouble like that?

i'm out here.

however, a cashcounter like him is a rare opportunity

damn, i usually make it a rule not to stick my neck out,but

hey, another hot afternoon, isn't it?

i,i'm actually looking for someone.

hey, doc, you're living in there?

doctor, what are you doing? he has got a gun, dummy.

mother and i, we often used to go walking together.
on summer afternoon, there are lot like this one.
there was a long road wait, and long side of the field of sunfolwers
but ,mother's dead now.

this is important, so i need you to listen, did someone ask you to use that gun?

tell me, was it a man?

was it a man? it was.
 
one day, this young man come to me in the local bar

was he about 20 years old with a blonde hair

he was, he had a big bright and beautiful smile, call himself Eric.

so he is by Eric nowã€‚

we met few times, we eventually became close friends, he invited me over to the place where he was staying.

it was a estate of councilman Springer

did he live in that mansion until recently?
